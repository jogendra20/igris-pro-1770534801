The Super Simple version of the alphabet song, set to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, is a popular children's song. The song is slowly paced, allowing time for children to say each letter and follow along with an alphabet chart or other visual guide.

B, or b, is the second letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages, and others worldwide. The song highlights the letter B with various examples, such as:
B, B, B, we shout hooray,
Balls and boats in the bay.
B, B, B, by the babbling brook,
B, B, B, take a closer look.
B, B, B, in every nook,
B is the name of book.

This song is an engaging way for young children to learn about the alphabet and the sound of the letter B.
